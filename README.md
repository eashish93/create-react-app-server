This is an example of implementing react server rendering with facebook cli `create-react-app` without any ejection and modification.
Just simply make the frontend app as you would do using `create-react-app`. No need to change anything in client to make server rendering. It also uses <strong>async server rendering</strong> using `react-router`.

#### How to test
1. First create the build using `npm run build`.
2. Then type `npm run start:server` to see the production.
